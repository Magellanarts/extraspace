              Our executive management team has an average tenure of 17 years
              with Extra Space Storage, and succession plans are emphasized at
              every level of management. We have a track record of
              well-executed management transitions allowing us to seamlessly
              adapt to change. Our management team’s style has been praised by
              employees for its transparency, its encouragement of work life
              balance, and its ability to drive the team to bring their best
              selves to work. Our executive team has consistently been
              recognized on Wall Street for providing excellent “bang for the
              buck” when comparing compensation to total shareholder return.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our focus on top talent, is true at all levels of the company.
              From our call center, to our stores, to our store support
              center, we want the best people in every position we can find,
              and we want those people engaged and happy to stay at Extra
              Space. In our most recent employee engagement survey, we had an
              overall engagement rating of 85 of 100 with 86% of employees

            <p>
              Extra Space has always prioritized diversity and inclusion among
              employees, but in 2018 we decided to formalize our commitment to
              Diversity and Inclusion with a commitment statement, and by
              implementing a Diversity and Inclusion committee to steer the
              company’s continued improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2020, the Diversity and Inclusion committee formed
              subcommittees focused on education, employee resource groups,
              and community social involvement to continue to drive the many
              initiatives Extra Space had started. Their work earned Extra
              Space a spot on Forbes’ list of Best Employers for Diversity.
            </p>
            <p>
              “This is such important work, not only for Extra Space, but for
              the wider impact this can have on society. I am so proud to be a
              part of this company, which is leading the pack in Diversity and
              Inclusion and reaping the social and financial benefits of
              making space for everyone at the table.” – Store Manager in
              Kingston, NY

          <h2 class="u-secondary-heading mb-8">Our culture and values</h2>

          <p>
            Ask any employee at Extra Space about what makes Extra Space
            successful and they’ll point to our company culture and our
            company values. Our five values – Integrity, Excellence,
            Innovation, Teamwork and Passion – are at the center of everything
            we do. They steer the way we work, interact with customers, and
            behave in our communities. Our Company compass is a guide that
            gives direction to our strategy. Learn more about our company
