      Forward Looking Statement
    </h1>

    <div class="u-content u-body-copy pb-8">
      <p>
        Certain information set forth in this release contains
        “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal
        securities laws. Forward-looking statements include statements
        concerning the benefits of store acquisitions, developments, favorable
        market conditions, our outlook and estimates for the year and other
        statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future
        events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures,
        financing needs, the competitive landscape, plans or intentions
        relating to acquisitions and developments and other information that
        is not historical information. In some cases, forward-looking
        statements can be identified by terminology such as “believes,”
        “estimates,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “anticipates,” or
        “intends,” or the negative of such terms or other comparable
        terminology, or by discussions of strategy. We may also make
        additional forward-looking statements from time to time. All such
        subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, by us
        or on our behalf, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary
        statements. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could
        cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking
        statements contained in or contemplated by this release. Any
        forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the risks
        referenced in the “Risk Factors” section included in our most recent
        Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Such
        factors include, but are not limited to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          adverse changes in general economic conditions, the real estate
          industry and the markets in which we operate;
        </li>
        <li>
          failure to close pending acquisitions and developments on expected
          terms, or at all;
        </li>
        <li>
          the effect of competition from new and existing stores or other
          storage alternatives, which could cause rents and occupancy rates to
          decline;
        </li>
        <li>
          potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental
          contamination;
        </li>
        <li>
          the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national, state
          and local laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those
          governing real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), tenant
          reinsurance and other aspects of our business, which could adversely
          affect our results;
        </li>
        <li>
          disruptions in credit and financial markets and resulting
          difficulties in raising capital or obtaining credit at reasonable
          rates or at all, which could impede our ability to grow;
        </li>
        <li>
          impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic or the future outbreak of other
          highly infectious or contagious diseases, including reduced demand
          for self-storage space and ancillary products and services such as
          tenant reinsurance, and potential decreases in occupancy and rental
          rates and staffing levels, which could adversely affect our results;
        </li>
        <li>increases in interest rates;</li>
        <li>
          reductions in asset valuations and related impairment charges;
        </li>
        <li>
          our lack of sole decision-making authority with respect to our joint
          venture investments;
        </li>
        <li>the effect of recent changes to U.S. tax laws;</li>
        <li>
          the failure to maintain our REIT status for U.S. federal income tax
          purposes; and
        </li>
        <li>
          economic uncertainty due to the impact of natural disasters, war or
          terrorism, which could adversely affect our business plan.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All forward-looking statements are based upon our current expectations
        and various assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are
        expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for
        them, but there can be no assurance that management’s expectations,
        beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. All
        forward-looking statements apply only as of the date made. We
        undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking
        statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after
        the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
